To create an Azure Pipeline using GitHub and Docker as the container registry, start by linking your GitHub repository to Azure Pipelines. This can be done through the Azure DevOps portal by selecting your project and navigating to Pipelines > Create Pipeline. Choose GitHub as the source and authenticate your account. Next, define your pipeline using a YAML file, specifying the necessary build and deployment stages. Ensure you include steps to build your Docker image and push it to Docker Hub or Azure Container Registry. Finally, commit the YAML file to your repository, and Azure Pipelines will automatically trigger the build and deployment process.
